# Fractal-Drawings
Attached in this repository are a few modules that generate fractal image drawings using Turtle and TkInter libraries. Many of the classes within the code files are developed using object-oriented programming and inheritance. Accompanied with the code is a presentation containing UML diagrams and high-level design graphs.
